 The Feed-forward Neural Network is the first foray into the world of Deep Learning.  The basic ideas and concepts in this most simple neural network prevail throughout the course. 

The goal of this assignment is twofold. 
First we implement a configurable neural network with backpropagation algorithm, and implement different optimizers as schemas for  gradient descent. Second we get familiar with this brilliant tool called wandb to run and keep track of our experiments and visualize the results.

This has been attempted as a interactive colab experiment. We have created a class $NeuralNet$ with different methods for the optimizers.  To run the code, open it on colab , create an object instance with your preferred configurations and then call your preferred optimizer.

We have achieved a test accuracy of 87.98% for the fashion-mnist dataset , and a test accuracy of 97.8% with mnist dataset.
