## Assignment 3
This assignment is part of CS6910 course of IIT Madras - Fundamentals of Deep Learning.

We have implemented an encoder decoder model with configurable hyperparameters.
This has been accomplished with the help of keras library.  
The model can use RNN, GRU or LSTM as the encoder/decoder layers of the model. It can be configured with multiple encoder or decoders as well.
We have used wandb to tune the hyperparameters .
The code is in the form of a Notebook for interctive use.
